author: Jan van Bon
overview: 
principles:
- principle: A process describes WHAT must be done in succession, not the who or how
- principle: A process can therefore be interpreted as a verb.
- principle: A process is countable.
- principle: Processes have a relevant and unique output for the customer.
- principle: Processes are not depending on conditions (â—Š)
- principle: A process can be broken down into sub-processes, but that does not change the process.
- principle: A process model organizes the processes.
- principle: A process model includes all activities.
- principle: In an integrated process model, each activity only occurs once.
